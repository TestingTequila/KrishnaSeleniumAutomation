TDD: Test Driven Development [TestNG/JUnit]
0. Can run test cases without using main method
1. Can run multiple test cases in one go
2. We can selectively run test cases in a specific order
3. Can generate report
4. Ignore some test cases and execute rest

TestNG: 3 A's ---> Annotations, Attributes, Assertions

@Annotations:
  -We use them with methods only
  @BeforeSuite
  @BeforeTest
  @BeforeClass
  @BeforeMethod   : This annotation will be executed before every test case
  @Test           : This annotation is used to represent the Test cases
  @AfterMethod   : This annotation will be executed after every test case
  @AfterClass
  @AfterTest
  @AfterSuite
  -------------
  @Parameter
  @DataProvider

Attributes:
  -We use Attributes along with annotations
  Priority
  Enabled
  alwaysRun
  timeout
  dependsOnMethods

Assertions:
 -We can use Assertions to validate Test cases
 -AssertTrue
 -AssertFalse
 -AssertEquals
 -AssertNotEquals
